# Logo was hand drawn by me and pictured with my phone then i uploaded it to img/logos app

# Slide pictures are pulled from the internet so you need internet connection

# Band picture is downloaded from the internet and uploaded to img/static , ive made it responsive to listen some of their work on you tube at a separate link
 Poncho Sanches and his Latin band I borrowed for the project purpose even tho the site is totally fictional.

# Ive based the location of the restaurant in Bora Bora and set up the address through google maps which openes on a separate link

# My phone number that is listed on contact section I connected with a code that I found online and if using on a smart phone will directly call my phone number.

# Menus took most of my time when working on this project sure the background image of the menu is taken from googles menu images as for all the content ive put together myself with previous knowledge and also some research

# Ive found out by my own curiosity that you can also change the navbar image by attaching some picture to it so ive linked it to a web based image to make it look different within the css in style

# Technologies used were : html5 , css , JavaScript, Cmder, GitHub and Bootstrap while working in SublimeText
